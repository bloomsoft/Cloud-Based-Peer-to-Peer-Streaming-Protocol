Cloud-Based-Peer-to-Peer-Streaming-Protocol
===========================================

We are developing this protocol that will Support the Video Streaming in an Environment where the Video to be Streamed can be 
Streamed to a Cloud based Environment and then When Viewers playing the app will work in a Different Fashion Cloud to Peer to Peer.

When a Viewer will Initiate the Connection the Required segment of the video will be first tried to get from the available peers which are online 
and have viewed that segment, if that segment not available on any peer then the cloud will be contacted to download that video segment.

Its going to be an Open Source Project so Any body can join it and play a positive and constructive role.
